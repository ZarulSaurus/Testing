# Welcome friends from Bangladesh!!

Hello hello! This repo is meant to demonstrate how I use git as a version control of my analysis, and to easily share it with my collaborators.

I will also boast the power that comes with using:

- python as a programming language,
- jupyter notebook for narrative programming and also for scrutinization by others,
- matplotlib for plotting
- snakemake for workflow manager, start-to-end

Have fun!
